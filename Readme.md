# Linear_regression---predicting_sales
Training and regularizing a linear machine learning model to predict a store weekly sales

The project has 3 main steps:
* Part 1 : EDA and all the necessary preprocessings to prepare data for machine learning
* Part 2 : Training a linear regression model 
* Part 3 : Fighting overfitting by training a regularized regression model

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Data

The dataset ("Walmart_Store_sales.csv") contains information about weekly sales achieved by different Walmart stores, and other variables such as the unemployment rate or the fuel price, that might be useful for predicting the amount of sales. 

### Prerequisites

The source code is written in Python 3
The python packages can be installed with pip : pip3 install or !pip install if in jupyter notebook

### Installing

Check packages that need to be imported or installed in the requirements.txt file 

## Deployment
